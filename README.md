# Python Automation Testing With Pytest

### Goal: To develop the first automation framework using Python, the Pytest framework, and the Request library.

## Get started:
 1. Install Pytest:
pytest requires Python 3.7+
run the following command in your command line:
```
pip install -U pytest
```
2. Check that you installed correct version:
```
$ pytest â€“version
pytest 7.1.3
```
3. In python install next modules:
```
import requests
import xmltodict
```
5. Download repository
6. Run tests

## Running Tests
Pytest has many command line options with a powerful discovery mechanism:
```
python -m pytest          - to discover and run all tests from the current directory
python -m pytest -v       - to explicitly print the result of each test as it is run
python -m pytest -h       - for command line help
python pytest -v          - execute all tests in verbose mode
python pytest <filename>  - to execute specific test file
```
